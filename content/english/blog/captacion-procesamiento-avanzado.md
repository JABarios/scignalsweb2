### PROYECTO

The Valencian Institute of Business Competitiveness (Ivace) and the EU (FEDER funds), have co-financed the project "COLLECTION AND ADVANCED PROCESSING OF NIGHTTIME BIOMEDICAL SIGNALS TO IMPROVE COGNITIVE CAPACITIES", developed by the company SCIGNALS.


### ACHIEVED GOALS

- Use of the signalino platform as a recording system for electroencephalography signals during sleep to be wirelessly transferred to a mobile device.
- Development and implementation of the necessary algorithms for the detection of the various phases of sleep.
- Development and implementation of the necessary algorithms for the generation of a sound stimulus that is synchronized with the cerebral electrical signal during the slow sleep phase
- Design and development of a wearable system based on the miniaturized signalino platform, low cost, portable and with sufficient autonomy for 12 hours of continuous operation.
