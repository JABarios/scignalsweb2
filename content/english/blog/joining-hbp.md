Spanish Innovation Community
 
The [Spanish HBP National Innovation Community](https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/collaborate/innovation/national-hubs-for-innovation/spanish-national-hub-for-innovation/) was launched on Dec 14th at the Ministry of Science & Research, in Madrid. About 30 interested companies from sectors as biotechnology, pharma or bioinformatics attended the event, together with members of the Innovation & Technology Transfer Node and HBP researchers. Since then regular events are taking place including training workshops for the use of HBP Platforms. 

Several companies, industrial associations and biomedical institutions have already joined the Community, which is open to new members. Scignals has already joined the iniciative. Since then, the community has begun hosting regular events and training workshops focused on the practical use of EBRAINS, the European research infrastructure developed under the Human Brain Project. The initiative remains open to new members and already includes several companies, industrial associations, and biomedical institutions.

We are proud to announce that Scignals is now an active member of this community, reinforcing our commitment to neurotechnology innovation in Europe. Scignals has also been highlighted in the official HBP report “Where is European Brain Innovation Happening?” as one of the most promising Spanish start-ups in the field of neuromonitoring. The report emphasizes our focus on developing non-invasive, anatomically comfortable devices designed for prolonged use, which are especially suited for applications such as sleep monitoring and real-world neurofeedback.

Joining this strategic network will allow us to collaborate with key players in the field, leverage EBRAINS’ advanced tools, and continue developing cutting-edge technologies for brain monitoring and stimulation.
