Spanish Innovation Community
 
The [Spanish HBP National Innovation Community](https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/collaborate/innovation/national-hubs-for-innovation/spanish-national-hub-for-innovation/) was launched on Dec 14th at the Ministry of Science & Research, in Madrid. About 30 interested companies from sectors as biotechnology, pharma or bioinformatics attended the event, together with members of the Innovation & Technology Transfer Node and HBP researchers. Since then regular events are taking place including training workshops for the use of HBP Platforms. 

Several companies, industrial associations and biomedical institutions have already joined the Community, which is open to new members. Scignals has already joined the iniciative.
